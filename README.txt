App name: Gameder

Group Members: Hunter Hockman and David Waldron

Specifics:

The use of a swiper object and expo vector icons came from sections of this youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJaFIGjyRms&t=8961s

Async was originally planned, but since the user is not creating data an array was used to get the items that the user swiped right on.  

Comments should be up do date, but if there are any questions don't hesitate to email us. 

How to use: 

The app opens to the home screen where the user can swipe right to save a game to there list or they can swipe left to see the next one. When the user runs out of games they can hit the home (controller) button to restart the app. By hitting the list button in the top left the user can see the games they swiped right on in an organized list. By tapping the list icon the user will then be brought to a link where they can purchase the game. The link is the easiest way to buy/play the game for some it's amazon for others it is Steam.
